# dotfiles

Dotfiles for sensible OS X life. Heavily influenced by
https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.

Installing guide from [Sirile's blog](http://sirile.github.io/2015/01/26/setting-up-mac.html) for more information about installing.

## Install brew

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Clone the dotfiles

```
git clone https://github.com/oskarstucki/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

## Install the default packages with a bundle

```
cd .dotfiles
brew bundle
```

## Run RCM

RCM links the files in the .dotfiles folder to the userâ€™s home directory. This way they can easily be maintained with git in their own folder without the home folder becoming too complex with .gitignore.

```
rcup rcrc
rcup -f
```

### Make GNU bash default shell

```
echo "/usr/local/bin/bash" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
```

## Install nvm

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash

```
